              <h2>How 'Payments as a Product' Can Help Your Business</h2>
              <span>By Chuck Phipps &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; March 23, 2017</span>
              <h6>First published on LinkedIn</h6><br>

                <p>Peter Drucker <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060878975/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060878975&linkCode=as2&tag=whitneyhess-20" target="_blank">said</a>, “The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer.” So, ask yourself: What single event draws the line between a customer and a non-customer? </p>

                <p> The answer is: Buying your product or service. And a purchase is not complete until the payment happens.</p>

                <p><strong style="font-family: sans-serif">Paying for your product is what makes your customer a customer.</strong></p>

                <p>Naturally, you want many paying customers so your startup will survive and your company thrive! And of course you want growth by keeping them. So the function of accepting payments becomes a defining feature of your product set and is often one of your users’ first experiences.</p>

                <p>Payments as a Product (PaaP) is a concept that all companies must embrace during the fintech juggernaut that is happening now. The next 5-years are destined to be the most transformative in the history of electronic payments, so companies of every stripe should examine their user-experience of paying. That is, if they want traction, growth, and retention.</p>

                <p>For example: I enjoy scrounging through discount stores and thrift shops to hunt for off-price treasures. Numerous times, having stumbled upon a true bargain (meaning: useless but desirable), I’ve grabbed an item on impulse only to face a 15-minute check-out line among the understaffed cashiers. No thanks! Back on the shelf it goes – the equivalent of an abandoned shopping cart and a lost sale. And reluctance to try that store again in the future.</p>

                <p>Grocery chains have been aware of this fact for years: checking out should take much less time than it takes to fill the grocery basket. Non-profits have long known that failing to capture the payment while a potential donor is in a charitable mood can result in many lost donations.</p>

                <p>Why shouldn’t the payment experience be easier for your would-be customer than the decision to buy?</p>
                <p>For this all-important function, rather than simply bolting on a card-accepting service with PaaA (Payments as an Afterthought), you should build the payment process as a product feature. Not only can that feature be a compelling experience, it can drive sales and customer loyalty.</p>

                <p>How then, can PaaP be designed? There are two steps:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Make it easier, faster, and better than the “decision to buy”.</strong> Who doesn’t love impulse-buying with iTunes? You hear a song on Pandora, click the “Buy Now” button, type in your simple Apple password and, with one more click, the song is downloading to your phone.</p>

                <p>Amazon was the first to introduce a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/7smbfan9c84m7rd" target="_blank">“1-Click”</a> purchase in 1997, with payment and shipping information having been previously recorded, so this concept isn’t new. So why are countless mobile and e-commerce sites still requiring a clunky 16-digit card number, plus a 6-digit expiration date, plus 3-digit CVV code every time?</p>

                <p><strong>2. Make the payment disappear.</strong>  As your payments become easier and faster, the experience will eventually be nothing to notice. This is sometimes called “sandwich UX”, or focusing on what surrounds the key activity. That means your PaaP will need to become tightly intertwined with the rest of your product and the purchasing decision.</p>

                <p>As Brett King said in a 2015 <a href="http://sites.tcs.com/tcsbancs/insights/future-of-payments/" target="_blank">interview</a> with the TCS Group, “If the payment becomes invisible, the priority shifts to what happens before and after the payment, rather than the payment itself. This requires broad collaboration.”</p>

                <p>The best example of this is Starbuck’s mobile app that has replaced their (at one time innovative) plastic prepaid cards. It has drawn legions of customers into their stores because it’s fun, it’s easy, and you get free stuff. Turning on “product management for payments” is how they did it.</p>

                <p>In the current era of You-Name-It Pay (<a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/" target="_blank">Apple</a>, <a href="https://pay.amazon.com/us/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.android.com/pay/" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>) and <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/innovation/biometrics-next-frontier-payments.html/" target="_blank">biometrics</a> and <a href="https://squareup.com/townsquare/what-does-tokenization-actually-mean" targer="_blank">tokenization</a>, the merchant with a superior digital and mobile-first payment experience will move to the front of your market.</p>

                <p>When shopping for a product I want, but possibly don’t need all that much (the latest pop tunes will not prolong my existence), paying for it should be a breeze that delightfully guides me from “wanting” to “having.”</p>
